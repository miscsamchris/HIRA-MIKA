## The Lone Samurai
The main objective of the project is to provide a digital record of the medication and condition of the patient while maintaining a user friendly interface for the nurses and medical attendants. It also will have the functionality of monitoring the condition of the patient remotely and also helps visitors interaction by providing an AR chatbot for them to interact with. This helps them make themselves aware of the patients symptoms and also helps them pass the time constructively by providing them some soothing AR Based Videos.
